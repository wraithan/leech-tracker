Leech Tracker
=============

Site that logs every time you go off course when using leech block and logs the
site that you were trying to go to and the time. Dual purpose. First it lets you
see what sites you tried to go to so you can remember to check out those cute
cat videos your friend linked too. Second it lets you track the amount of times,
what sites, and when distractions/attempted procrastination occurs.

Notes
-----

Started in Clojure, decided it was not mature enough to build this project. Docs
are sparse and most things rely on blog posts or wikis as documentation.
