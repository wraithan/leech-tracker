Leech Tracker
=============

Site that logs every time you go off course when using leech block and logs the
site that you were trying to go to and the time. Dual purpose. First it lets you
see what sites you tried to go to so you can remember to check out those cute
cat videos your friend linked too. Second it lets you track the amount of times,
what sites, and when distractions/attempted procrastination occurs.

Notes
-----

Stack options (that I am considering):

* node/express
* clojure/noir
* python/django

Pretty simple, want to be able to deploy to heroku and forget about it unless it
blows up and gets big.

Maybe clojure/noir as the API/backend thing and a light JS/html page that uses
it for the front end.
